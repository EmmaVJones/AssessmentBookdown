# DEQ Water Quality Automated Assessment User Guide

This repository holds scripts to build a companion bookdown to the automated assessment methods used for Water Quality Assessments. 

The book details the history of automated WQA assessment processes, details on data organization steps, breaks down assessment functions, and provides hands on examples to understand the assessment function in action. 

## Audience

This book is written for users familiar with R, but R is not a prerequisite for understanding the narrative descriptions of how the assessment process is completed via automation. Please see the internally hosted DEQ R Methods Encyclopedia for more information on how to get started with R.
