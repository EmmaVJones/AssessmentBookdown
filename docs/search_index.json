Virginia is among a handful of state agencies that have organized concerted efforts to systematically automate and expedite the water quality assessment process. These entities have all taken different approaches to best meet their state-specific analysis and reporting needs. Through the Tools for Automated Data Assessment (TADA) working group, EPA is organizing an effort to share code and create national tools to assist partners with assessment analyses. Considering the technological advances in water monitoring that have increased the quantity and types of data requiring consideration during an assessment period, as well as the static or decreasing staff time allocated to the assessment process, automation appears the only solution to keep up with Clean Water Act requirements and keep the public informed of the status of waterbody health and restoration timelines for those waterbodies not meeting water quality standards. By embracing automated assessment procedures, entities aim to provide constituents with higher quality, standardized, and transparent water quality assessment results while adhering to federally mandated deadlines. Virginia has taken a hybrid approach to the process of automating the water quality assessments. DEQ relies upon an automated process to manipulate hundreds of thousands of water quality data collected throughout the state during a given assessment period (six year window). These scripts evaluate each record for exceedances of appropriate Water Quality Standards. Regional assessment staff may use interactive web-based analytical tools provide more context to tabular results of exceedance analyses to assist with Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) prior to submitting data to EPAs Assessment, Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Tracking and Implementation System (ATTAINS) system through DEQs internal Comprehensive Environmental Data System (CEDS). This approach maximizes the benefits of each partner in the assessment process, allowing computers to excel at systematic and expedited data manipulation and analysis at scale and allowing humans to digest multiple lines of evidence to identify any potential data collection or analysis errors or areas of environmental concern. "],["HowToUseDocument.html", "1.1 How to Use Document", " 1.1 How to Use Document The following report is an agency effort to facilitate the further adoption of automated assessment methods statewide. The intention of this project is to provide a non-programmer audience with accessible and understandable narratives describing the automated water quality assessment process. This document is not a comprehensive WQA Guidance Manual, nor is it an introduction to using the R programming language. Here, we document the overall automated assessment process, explaining reasons certain decisions were made, and how to unpack analyses. "],["ProjectHistory.html", "1.2 Project History", " 1.2 Project History The agency began efforts toward automating components of the IR with a dissolved metals assessment written in SAS. These tabular results were provided to regional assessment staff along with raw data queries encompassing data stored in CEDS for each IR data window. The Freshwater Probabilistic Monitoring program began automating analyses and a final report for inclusion in the 2016 IR using the open source R programming language. These practices have been further refined each IR cycle, improving report quality and graphics as well as significantly reducing the amount of time required to generate a report after data collection. These methods were identified as a possible solution to the ongoing challenges in the WQA program to complete vast amounts of data analysis on increasingly short timelines with limited staff. An effort to systematically analyze all water quality data stored in CEDS for assessments began in 2017. As a pilot project, lakes and reservoirs in the Blue Ridge Regional Office (BRRO) assessment region were selected for first waterbody type to undergo automation and receive an interactive web-based tool to assist regional assessment staff for the 2018 IR. These initial automated assessment efforts were completed using the open source R programming language and interactive applications were built using the Shiny package. Rivers and streams followed suit for the 2020 IR, joining lacustrine waterbodies with automated assessment methods and interactive assessment tools. The 2020 IR automated methods were scaled from just the BRRO region to statewide applicability. A pilot project to incorporate citizen monitoring data requiring assessment was undertaken in the BRRO assessment region for the 2020 IR. This pilot proved effective in standardizing and increasing efficiency of incorporating this disparate data and was officially adopted as a process for future IR windows. After thorough QA from regional assessment staff across the state, the riverine and lacustrine automated assessment tools were rebooted for the 2022 IR with increased functionality and the ability to assess more parameters, including those not stored in CEDS. However, due to delays organizing citizen monitoring data statewide, automated results for these data were not provided for the 2022 IR. A new database schema for archiving station-specific water quality standards and assessment unit information was implemented. This system benefited the assessment process as well as numerous DEQ water programs that previously did not have access to WQS information at that spatial scale. Appendices and fact sheets for the IR were generated using R and Rmarkdown for the first time during the 2022 IR. The 2024 IR further refines improvements to the riverine and lacustrine automated assessment methods and interactive tools. By partnering with the Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC), DEQ leveraged an existing public-facing citizen monitoring data portal to expand utility outside the Chesapeake Bay watershed and incorporate all of Virginias citizen monitoring data. These data are now automatically cleaned and stored by the CMC and can more easily be incorporated in the automated assessment process with web scraping techniques. To date, no estuarine-specific assessment methods have been completed, but the WQA program is investigating utility and potential adoption among regions with estuarine waters.

"],["data-organization.html", "Chapter 2 Data Organization", " Chapter 2 Data Organization The assessment process requires hundreds of thousands of rows of data collected and stored by DEQ, other state agencies, and citizen partners. These disparate data sources require various levels of data manipulation prior to any analysis. SAS and R are used for the majority of the assessment data cleaning and manipulation processes. 2.0.1 Data Location Most data used for assessments are stored in DEQs internal Comprehensive Environmental Data System (CEDS) and made available through a direct connection to the reporting database known as ODS. The agency is working towards storing all data required for assessments in CEDS, but as of the time of writing the following datasets are stored in locations outside of CEDS: * Fish Tissue Data * PCB Data * VDH Data * Citizen Monitoring Data * Station Metadata It is important to note that although the data that consitute the conventionals dataset are derive from CEDS/ODS, official assessment records of this data are only stored locally in Microsoft Excel outputs. 2.0.2 Data Availablility Most of the following data are provided at the beginning of the assessment process (approximately March of an assessment year). Any delays in data availability have ripple effects on the ability of regional assessors to complete their work on time. Should data be provided for assessment after the expected availability date, assessors may not be able to include said data in a given assessment window. Exceptions to the March data availability date usually apply to Citizen Monitoring, bioassessment, and fish tissue data. Citizen Monitoring data have historically been provided to regional assessment staff in April of a given assessment year. Bioassessment data for the most recent two years of an assessment window trickles in to the assessment process through the summer of a given assessment year due to the lengthy identification process associated with benthic macroinvertebrate samples. Fish tissue data requires protracted laboratory analyses before it is provided back to DEQ from contractor labs for assessment purposes. Due to these data delays, regional assessment staff generally have to delay certain assessment steps until all data is available for a given station/Assessment Unit, making automated assessment methods ever more important when data are provided. "],["conventionals-data.html", "2.1 Conventionals Data", " 2.1 Conventionals Data The conventionals dataset contains the bulk of the data analyzed during any given assessment window. Historically, this dataset has been queried using SAS and a direct connection to the raw monitoring data in the ODS reporting database (the database that makes CEDS data accessible to reporting tools). Recently, efforts to streamline the assessment process and standardize data provided across agency programs produced an effort to convert these SAS scripts into R. The conventionals query combines WQM field and analyte data with data handling steps that standardize data discrepancies like multiple lab values returned for identical sample date/times, full parameter speciation but no total value, etc. This R query and data standardization method is considered to be under development as code review is a constant part of data improvement strategies. The current version of the R based conventionals query is available here. In order to access the data the conventionals function calls, users must have a direct connection to ODS from their environment. Please see the DEQ R Methods Encyclopedia article on ODS for more information.

This data system required multiple iterations of lengthy data standardization and QA/QC processes in order to ensure the data were utilized for assessments. A standardized system requiring citizen groups to either upload their data to the Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC) Data Explorer and DEQ scraping the CMC API using automated R scripts or provide all data to DEQ in a standardized template has replaced previous data receiving methods. Citizen data not stored in the CMC database live on DEQ staff computers and require further storage solutions.
